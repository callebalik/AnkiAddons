## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0-beta.1] - 2021-08-04

### Added

- Added suport for modern Anki versions (tested up to Anki 2.1.46)
- The add-on now sports a sleek new pop-up design and effects, optimized both for light mode and dark mode
- Searches can now also be triggered by selecting a phrase and right-clicking
- Added an option to exclude new notes from snippet results (thanks to @zjosua!)

### Fixed

- Changed the default add-on hotkey to "Alt+Shift+D" (âŒ¥+â‡§+D on macOS) to avoid a conflict with default key bindings on Anki 2.1.41 and up
- Fixed an issue that would cause an error when opening cards in the browser (thanks to @Nanco300 for the report!)
- Fixed an issue that would cause images within the pop-ups to not be sized correctly (thanks to @padenw24 for the report!)
- Made the add-on more resilient against conflicts with user-made deck styling
- Made the add-on more resilient against conflicts with other add-ons (tested against the top 200 most popular add-ons)

### Changed

- Refactored major parts of the add-on, making it more robust and future-proof
- Dropped support for older Anki versions. The minimum supported version is now 2.1.23.
